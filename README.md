# Recreating-Fingerprints-using-Convolutional-Autoencoders

Build a Neural network that is capable of recreating or reconstructing fingerprint images using Convolutional Autoencoders.

The dataset that Iâ€™m using is the FVC2002 fingerprint dataset. It consists of 4 different sensor fingerprints namely Low-cost Optical Sensor, Low-cost Capacitive Sensor, Optical Sensor and Synthetic Generator, each sensor having varying image sizes. The dataset has 320 images, 80 images per sensor.
